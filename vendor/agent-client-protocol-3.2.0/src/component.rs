//! ConnectTo abstraction for agents and proxies.
//!
//! This module provides the [`ConnectTo`] trait that defines the interface for things
//! that can be run as part of a conductor's chain - agents, proxies, or any ACP-speaking component.
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! Components connect to other components, creating a chain of message processors.
//! The type parameter `R` is the role that this component connects to (its counterpart).
//!
//! To implement a component, implement the `connect_to` method:
//!
//! ```rust
//! use agent_client_protocol::{Agent, Client, ConnectTo, Result};
//!
//! struct MyAgent;
//!
//! // An agent connects to clients
//! impl ConnectTo<Client> for MyAgent {
//!     async fn connect_to(self, client: impl ConnectTo<Agent>) -> Result<()> {
//!         Agent.builder()
//!             .name("my-agent")
//!             .connect_to(client)
//!             .await
//!     }
//! }
//! ```

/// The type parameter `R` is the role that this component connects to (its counterpart).

///
/// # Component Types
///
/// The trait is implemented by several built-in types representing different communication patterns:
///
/// - **[`Lines`]**: A component communicating over asynchronous line streams
/// - **[`ByteStreams`]**: A component communicating over byte streams (stdin/stdout, sockets, etc.)
/// - **[`Channel`]**: A component communicating via in-process message channels (for testing or direct connections)
/// - **Custom components**: Proxies, transformers, or any ACP-aware service

/// # Two Ways to Connect
///
/// Components can be used in two ways:
///
/// 1. **`connect_to(client)`** - Connect directly to another component (most components implement this)
/// 2. **`into_channel_and_future()`** - Obtain a channel endpoint and optional owned driver
///
/// Most components only need to implement `connect_to(client)`. The
/// `into_channel_and_future()` method has a default implementation that creates an intermediate
/// channel and calls `connect_to`.
///
/// # Implementation Example
///
/// ```rust
/// use agent_client_protocol::{Agent, Client, ConnectTo, Result};
///
/// struct MyAgent;
///
/// impl ConnectTo<Client> for MyAgent {
///     async fn connect_to(self, client: impl ConnectTo<Agent>) -> Result<()> {
///         Agent.builder()
///             .name("my-agent")
///             .connect_to(client)
///             .await
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// # Heterogeneous Collections
///
/// For storing different component types in the same collection, use [`DynConnectTo`]:
///
/// ```rust
/// use agent_client_protocol::{Channel, Client, DynConnectTo};
///
/// let (first, _first_peer) = Channel::duplex();
/// let (second, _second_peer) = Channel::duplex();
/// let components: Vec<DynConnectTo<Client>> = vec![
