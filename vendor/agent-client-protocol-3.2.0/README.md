# agent-client-protocol

Core protocol types and traits for the [Agent Client Protocol (ACP)](https://agentclientprotocol.com/).

ACP is a protocol for communication between AI agents and their clients (IDEs, CLIs, etc.),
enabling features like tool use, permission requests, and streaming responses.

## What can you build with this crate?

- **Clients** that talk to ACP agents (like building your own Claude Code interface)
- **Proxies** that add capabilities to existing agents (like adding custom tools via MCP)
- **Agents** that respond to prompts with AI-powered responses

## Quick Start: Connecting to an Agent

The most common use case is connecting to an existing ACP agent as a client.
This quick start uses stable protocol v1 and the opt-in `process` feature.
For the upcoming 3.x release, use:

```toml
agent-client-protocol = { version = "3", features = ["process"] }
```

```rust,no_run
use agent_client_protocol::{AcpAgent, Client, Result};
use agent_client_protocol::schema::{ProtocolVersion, v1::InitializeRequest};

# async fn connect() -> Result<()> {
let agent = AcpAgent::from_args(["my-agent"])?;
Client.builder()
    .name("my-client")
    .connect_with(agent, async |cx| {
        // Initialize the connection
        cx.send_request(InitializeRequest::new(ProtocolVersion::V1))
            .block_task()
            .await?;

        Ok(())
    })
    .await
# }
```

Draft protocol v2 is opt-in through `unstable_protocol_v2`. `Client.v2()`,
`Agent.v2()`, and `Proxy.v2()` callbacks receive a version-typed
`V2ConnectionTo` with
high-level, command-only session helpers because prompt acceptance and inbound
traffic are independent. Session updates and interactive requests use typed
connection handlers. See [Protocol V2](https://agentclientprotocol.github.io/rust-sdk/protocol-v2.html#high-level-v2-sessions).
`Proxy.builder()` remains the stable v1 entry point. Use
`Proxy.protocol_router()` to expose separate strict v1 and v2 proxy
implementations as one component; custom raw routing infrastructure can use
`Proxy.builder().without_acp_version_guard()`.

### Runnable draft-v2 pair

The `simple_agent_v2` example implements the complete baseline session
lifecycle, and `v2_one_shot_client` demonstrates the split prompt lifecycle:
the prompt response acknowledges acceptance, while output and completion arrive
through `session/update` notifications.

```bash
cargo build -p agent-client-protocol \
  --features process,stdio,unstable_protocol_v2 \
  --examples

./target/debug/examples/v2_one_shot_client \
  --command ./target/debug/examples/simple_agent_v2 \
  "Hello from ACP v2"
```

See the [Runnable Protocol V2 Quickstart](https://agentclientprotocol.github.io/rust-sdk/protocol-v2-quickstart.html)
for the lifecycle invariants to preserve when adapting these examples.

## Choosing request publication

`send_request(request)` sends immediately, with unchanged behavior.
`prepare_request(request)` waits until a consuming method is called:

```rust,ignore
connection.prepare_request(request).on_receiving_result(async move |result| {
    // Enqueue or apply bounded work before later inbound messages.
    handle_result(result)?;
    Ok(())
})?;
```

Preparation installs callback ordering before publication, avoiding a race with
fast responses. `block_task()` and `detach()` instead select unordered
consumption and send during the method call; dropping an unconsumed prepared
request sends nothing. Both raw and v2 connections also offer
`prepare_request_to(peer, request)`.

See [Sending Requests](https://agentclientprotocol.github.io/rust-sdk/sending-requests.html)
for ordering limits, cancellation, errors, and migration guidance.

## Cargo Features

No features are enabled by default. The protocol engine, serialization,
clients, agents, proxies, custom MCP servers, and generic `Channel`, `Lines`,
and `ByteStreams` adapters do not require native I/O or JSON Schema generation.

| Feature | Provides |
| --- | --- |
| `process` | Native subprocess support through `AcpAgent` and `AcpAgentConfig` |
| `stdio` | The native `Stdio` adapter |
| `schemars` | `JsonSchema` implementations and typed MCP tool helpers |
| `wasm_js` | UUID randomness for JavaScript-hosted WebAssembly |

`process` and `stdio` are independent. Native `LineDirection` is available
with either. The `McpTool` trait, `McpToolRegistry` and its metadata types, and
the `mcp_server::tool_fn` / `mcp_server::tool_fn_mut` functions require
`schemars`. Unstable protocol features remain independent opt-ins.

`agent-client-protocol-rmcp` explicitly enables `schemars` for its tool builders.
See [Cargo Features](https://agentclientprotocol.github.io/rust-sdk/features.html)
for configuration and migration examples. When upgrading from 2.x, enable the
features your application uses explicitly; a lean dependency no longer needs
`default-features = false`.

## MCP Server Attachment

The runtime-agnostic `mcp_server` module can build and directly serve standalone
MCP servers without enabling an ACP schema extension. Attaching one to ACP with
the `with_mcp_server` builder methods requires `unstable_mcp_over_acp`.
Attached servers are advertised with native `McpServer::Acp` declarations and
communicate through request-scoped `mcp/message` operations targeting MCP
2026-07-28, without connect/disconnect or initialization handshakes. Use
`agent-client-protocol-polyfill` immediately before an HTTP-capable agent.
Stable protocol v1 supports per-session and global proxy attachment. Draft
protocol v2 supports both scopes when both unstable features are enabled:
`Proxy.v2().with_mcp_server(...)` injects a global server into supported setup
requests, `V2SessionBuilder::with_mcp_server(...)` attaches one to a single
`session/new`, and `V2ResumeSessionBuilder::with_mcp_server(...)` attaches one
to a single `session/resume`. With `unstable_session_fork`,
`V2ForkSessionBuilder::with_mcp_server(...)` attaches one to a single
`session/fork`. In v1, `ActiveSession` owns per-session MCP registrations:
dropping it removes them unless a proxy handoff detaches them
(`proxy_remaining_messages` or successful `on_proxy_session_start`).
Successful v2 setup detaches MCP handlers for the connection lifetime, so
dropping the returned `V2Session` does not unregister them. Global proxy
attachments are connection-scoped in both versions.
A v2 proxy can forward any of these setup operations with the
builder's `on_proxy_session_start`; updates and interactive requests remain
independent connection traffic.

## WebAssembly

The runtime-neutral protocol engine and transport abstractions compile for
`wasm32-wasip1` and `wasm32-wasip2` without additional features. For
JavaScript-hosted `wasm32-unknown-unknown`, enable `wasm_js`; it selects Web
Crypto through `wasm-bindgen` as the UUID randomness backend. The target does
not imply a JavaScript host, so this feature is not enabled by default. Other
OS-less WebAssembly hosts must arrange a compatible UUID randomness backend.

The native `AcpAgent` and `Stdio` implementations are not available on
WebAssembly targets. See the [transport architecture](https://agentclientprotocol.github.io/rust-sdk/transport-architecture.html)
for the runtime-neutral embedding options.
